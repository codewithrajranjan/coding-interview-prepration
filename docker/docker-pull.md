> ## docker pull

- when we want to pull an official image then we need to use the notation of 
    - <repository-name>:<tag>
- when we want to pull third party image from the docker hub then we want to use
    - <userId>/<repository-name>:<tag>
- when we want to fetch the image other than docker hub which means from other registry then we want to use
    - <registry-address>/<userid>/<repository-name>:<tag>
